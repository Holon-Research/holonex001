 * 3. Reviews full score history to assess trajectory
 * 4. Generates specific, actionable feedback

 * @param scoreHistory - All previous steps' scores and content
 * @param target - Dharma threshold target (0-1 scale)
 * @returns Targeted feedback string for next step

PHILOSOPHICAL DEFINITIONS (use these, not keywords):

1. MINDFULNESS (Meta-Awareness):
   - Does reasoning show awareness of its own process?
   - Are assumptions, biases, and limitations explicitly noted?
   - Is there reflection on the approach itself?

2. EMPTINESS (Conceptual Flexibility):
   - Are conclusions held lightly and provisionally?
   - Is uncertainty acknowledged?
   - Are alternative interpretations considered?

3. NON-DUALITY (Interconnection):
   - Are complementary perspectives recognized?
   - Is either/or framing avoided?
   - Are interdependencies and trade-offs considered?

4. BOUNDLESS CARE (Universal Concern):
   - Is impact on all stakeholders considered?
   - Are potential harms examined?
   - Is the circle of concern expanded?

CURRENT STEP SELF-SCORES:
${JSON.stringify({ ...currentScores, mean: currentMean }, null, 2)}

SCORE HISTORY (trajectory across all ${scoreHistory.length} previous steps):
${scoreHistory.map((entry, idx) => `Step ${entry.step}: mean=${entry.mean.toFixed(3)} [M:${entry.scores.mindfulness.toFixed(2)} E:${entry.scores.emptiness.toFixed(2)} N:${entry.scores.nonDuality.toFixed(2)} B:${entry.scores.boundlessCare.toFixed(2)}]`).join('\n')}

THRESHOLD TARGET: ${target.toFixed(2)} (current: ${currentMean.toFixed(2)})

ANALYSIS TASK:
1. Assess the score trajectory: Is reasoning moving toward the threshold ${target}?
2. Identify which principle dimensions are weakest (below ${target})
3. Provide specific, actionable feedback for the NEXT reasoning step
4. Reference the philosophical definitions, not just numeric scores
5. Be concise but targeted (2-3 sentences max)

Focus especially on dimensions scoring below ${target}. If scores are stagnant, suggest new approaches.
